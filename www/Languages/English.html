                Act the way that the people around you are acting. This phrase might come in handy when you're traveling abroad notice that people do things differently than you're used to.</p>

                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"Birds of a feather flock together."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                People like to spend time with others who are similar to them.</p>

                If you have an enemy, pretend to be friends with them instead of openly fighting with them. That way you can watch them carefully and figure out what they're planning.</p>

                Sometimes it's important to know when to give up and run away, instead of always acting brave and maybe getting hurt.</p>

                When you try to do something great, you'll probably make a few people annoyed or angry. Don't worry about those people; just focus on the good results.</p>

                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"Actions speak louder than words."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                Just saying that you'll do something doesn't mean much. Actually doing it is harder and more meaningful.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                Don't try to improve something that already works fairly well. You'll probably end up causing new problems.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"Practice makes perfect."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                You have to practice a skill a lot to become good at it.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"Too many cooks spoil the broth."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                When there are too many people trying to lead and give their opinions, it's confusing and leads to bad results. Jobs and projects should have one or two strong leaders.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"Easy come, easy go."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                When you get something quickly without having to work too hard for it, it's easy to spend it or lose it quickly as well.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"Don't bite the hand that feeds you."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                If someone's paying you or helping you out, you have to be careful not to make them angry or say bad things about them. </p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"All good things must come to an end."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                You can't keep having good luck or fun forever; eventually it will stop.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"If you can't beat them, join them."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                When you try to change someone's behavior and it doesn't work, you might have to change instead. For example, if you're trying to get your classmates to focus on studying but they want to party, maybe you should just party with them.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">

                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"There's no time like the present."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                If you need to do something, don't wait until later. Do it now.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                Different people have different ideas about what's beautiful.</p>

                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"A penny saved is a penny earned."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                Save your money. Saving money is just like making money.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"Familiarity breeds contempt."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                When you're around someone for too long, you get tired of them and annoyed by them.</p>
                </li>
                <li  class="ui-li ui-li-static ui-body-c">
                <h3 class="proverbTitle ui-li-heading">"You can't judge a book by its cover."</h3> <p class="ui-li-desc">
                Things sometimes look different than they really are. A restaurant that looks old and small might have amazing food, for example.</p>
                </li>
